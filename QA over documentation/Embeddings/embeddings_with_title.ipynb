Its principles shall be applied to both in-house business systems , such as : Management of internal documentation , for example : Quality and process documentation ( including this document ) Internal reports HR , Financial reports and documentation Inventory of Hardware ( computers , satellite communications equipment , etc .) Archives and all deliverable systems , such as : Business stage deliverables like offers and proposals Project stage deliverables such as hardware and software systems Administrative stage deliverables , such as invoicing , purchasing , shipping reports and details In short , any Kratos system whose consistent performance is important and where the components are configurable , particularly by more than one person .

Configuration Management ( CM ) is a process to establish and maintain the consistency of a product’s performance , to stay in-line with its requirements , design , and operational information throughout its life . That is , it is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time .',\n",
       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management, Chapter = Introduction, Paragraph = Why do we need to use Configuration Management?) When we apply CM over the life cycle of a system , we increase the visibility and control of its performance and its sub-components . Using CM is like a constant verification that a system is configured to perform as intended . It allows orderly management of system information and of required system changes . Orderly management means files or components are in their correct , or at least expected place , and that all teams involved in the management of the system are aware of changes already made or to be made . A system that does not have CM principles in place can be disorganized and difficult to maintain . Changes may be made by users that other users are unaware of , leading to conflicts or unexpected system behaviour . Because changes are not tracked , reverting back to how the system was before ( in its working state ) requires troubleshooting to work out what is the issue , which can take time and be costly .',\n",

       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management, Chapter = How is Configuration Management implemented at Kratos?, Paragraph = Hardware and Software Systems) For the specific company application of CM in the domain of Hardware and Software systems for Projects , please refer to Configuration Management for Projects . There are 5 ‘disciplines’ of CM for systems with many hardware or software components ( or both ). CM Planning and Management This is represented by formally writing down a plan for CM . Configuration Identification This discipline is to set and maintain a baseline for the architecture , and its subcomponents . For the system as a whole , this is represented by the System Design Document ( SDD ), which shall be updated as the architecture of the system changes . For specific files or components of a system , this is a list of items which can be verified and updated , such as a list of hardware components with their serial numbers , or a list of files with their checksums . The important part is not just the list of components , but creating a list with information that allows the verification of their continued “correct” state . This verification can either be manual , such as manually verifying each serial number in a list of hardware components , or automatic , like using a software tool like SVN to check that all registered files in a system have the correct checksum . The continued updating of this list is outlined further in Configuration Status Accounting . The verification , which shall occur regularly , is outlined further in Configuration Verification and Audit , outlined as the 5th discipline below . For hardware , there shall be a record of hardware with serial numbers as part of the purchasing process ( Warranty Inspection Form ) and also as part of System identification testing . For software , this list is represented as the Software Versioning Document ( SVD ). Configuration Control Configuration control is the process of evaluating change requests , and controlling modifications to the system . Changes to a system in development do not necessarily need to be evaluated and accepted by all parties , but they shall at least be tracked . For software systems , this can be done with an automated software versioning tool ( e . g . SVN ). For hardware systems , this shall at least be done with a managed Excel document containing all pertinent serial/part numbers . Changes to a system that has been officially tested , or delivered , or in a ‘frozen state’, requires more formal tracking as well as continued use of the versioning tool/managed document . This is done by using a Change Request form . This can be a digital or printed form . What is important is that all involved parties are aware of what the change is , where it is needed , and why it is needed . These forms need to be numbered and archived , and accessible later , if required . A special case of this is when the system is under warranty or maintenance . In this scenario , the Change Request Form takes the form of the client or support engineer logging an issue in the support portal software . This is spoken about later in the Configuration Control section of CM Practices for Projects . Configuration Status Accounting Configuration Status Accounting is the process of regularly updating the original Configuration Identification list . That is , the list of files/hardware serial numbers within the versioning tool / managed document , and the SVD shall be updated with changes that have been made to the system ( which have hopefully gone through the correct Configuration Control process ). Automated software versioning tools are useful for this discipline for software systems , as it is easy to go back in time to see when departures from the baseline list were made . Different versions of the SVD are also a form of accounting , and are important , but can be too infrequent to be useful for troubleshooting . Configuration Verification and Audit Regular verification of the correctness of all critical components of a system is very important to keep a system in good shape . For software systems , this can be done by having a continual automated verification on all files that comes as part of some automated software versioning tools . This kind of continued monitoring will raise a flag on each file that is changed , or can be a regular check of the state of the system . A regular check of the state of a software system means using a tool to regenerate the original list of identified components ( discipline 1 above ) with the current checksum or version of those files , and then comparing this to the baseline list . For hardware systems , a regular audit of hardware serial and part numbers shall be done .

       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Introduction) A Configuration Management ( CM ) process is necessary to document and track changes to the software and documents during the development , installation , and maintenance phases of any project . Various tools will be introduced as examples to assist in the tracking of enhancements/problems throughout the project’s life . The type of tool to be used will depend on the product ( s ) installed , the architecture of the system and what part of the CM process is being followed . This section covers projects that could include various Kratos Communications products , with examples of specific use cases for project managers to see directly how to implement CM principles in their projects . The tools used may change , but what is important to take from this note is how to uphold the principles of CM along the life of the project .',\n",
       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Why do we need CM for projects? A real-life example of a CM failure) A KC Project Manager nearly caused a serious problem on a live system by forgotting to distribute a file to all servers . Forgetting one file in a situation where the person is dealing with multiple issues is quite human . However , it is this kind of oversight that implemetnation of adequate CM processes are meant to avoid . However , because adequate CM processes were not in place , because of this missing file , a maneuver procedure was run on a live satellite and failed at a crucial step . Worsening the stress of the situation was that the procedure had to be run very late at night . Sending the wrong maneuver information to a satellite can lead to a number of unwanted scenarios , including loss of service , loss of valuable fuel to return to the correct placement or orientation , or even loss of the ability to communicate with the satellite . At the time of the procedure failure , there was a huge amount of stress placed on that project manager , as it was obvious he was at fault , but also on the other people running the procedure , including the client manager , engineers and operators . Luckily the satellite was unaffected by the procedure failure , and the was problem rapidly solved . However , similar situations , while perhaps not leading to a catastrophic failure , can still lead to the loss of confidence in a newly installed system , meaning the requirement of more expensive testing , or the withholding of system acceptance , or the loss of confidence in personnel .',\n",

Take care , it is more difficult to establish good CM proctises for all the team after the project has already started . The aspects of CM are known as disciplines for a reason : they take work to implement and uphold . However , the benefits of a solid CM implementation far outweigh the “extra effort” taken . A solid CM implementation starts with a good CM plan . How each of the remaining 4 disciplines will be approached by the project within the CM Management Plan will need to be outlined . The plan shall be mentioned in the Project Management Plan document , and shall be outlined in more detail in the Product Assurance Plan document .',\n",
       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Implementing the 5 disciplines for projects, Paragraph = CM Planning and Management) This shall be outlined in the Project Management and Project Assurance Plan documents . This plan shall outline the remaining four disciplines below , addressing each of the remaining 4 disciplines : Configuration Identification Mention the System Versioning Document , which will have a list of all files on the server and workstations that can be monitored . This is the formal document that shall be delivered regularly to the client . Configuration Control Choose , with the help of the project technical team , an automated versioning software tool that can monitor files on the server and an automated versioning software tool for the ( e . g . Windows ) workstations . The same tool could do both . Of interest are automated versioning software tools that can also deploy a file that has been changed on the “master” server/workstation to the other “slave” server/workstations . This can save a lot of time and headaches . This may not be fully implementable once the systems are delivered and an air gap is required between systems . More than one automated versioning software tool can be used . For example , one type can be used for keeping track of files within the system , and another for any code development . For the development period , the change request process can be limited to the automated versioning software tool commit messages . Once the system is delivered however , the client will have to be ’in the loop\" for all changes , and an additional process will need to be implemented . Either it can be planned to get the client started early ( i . e . before the warranty period starts ) with the Kratos support portal software , or if this is not possible , instead a simple Microsoft Word form can be shared by email , or if all parties are still on site , a folder with empty printed paper forms that can be filled out with a pen and signed by all parties , once when the change is evaluated and accepted and once when the work has been checked as done . Other paperless solutions include setting up automated versioning software tool that includes strong change request support , such as GIT with its merge request architecture . A difficulty with this approach is to make sure that the client , Kratos Communications and perhaps one or more third parties to have access to this interface , even when away from site . Configuration Status Accounting For the internal engineering team and for troubleshooting purposes , this is usually handled well by the automated versioning software tool . However , a process will need to be described how the latest versions of software can be printed to update the SVD to send regularly to the client . Perhaps the automated versioning software tool can print checksums or versions of files , which can be pasted into the SVD . Otherwise , scripts that run the cksum function against each file will need to be used . Configuration Verification and Audit There needs to be a way to test that all files in the system that are being monitored under CM have their correct versions/checksums . The verification itself can be outputting/printing all current versions and comparing them using an Excel spreadsheet that doubles as the SVD to the baseline versions . Some automated software versioning tools with GUIs do this constantly . Once a file changes from baseline , a visual flag is set that the operator can notice . While this is useful for operations , this kind of feature shall not replace the SVD check .',\n",
       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Implementing the 5 disciplines for projects, Paragraph = CM Planning and Management) Once the plan is defined , the Project Manager ensures the discipline is applied by the technical team . If the plan is not being followed , it means that the team is cutting corners and could be introducing errors into the system that will be difficult to find at a later , perhaps more time sensitive period . A real-life example of how the “extra effort” of CM is well worth the time , even under time sensitive circumstances , is an Epoch project that was not well managed in terms of CM , up to the last 2 weeks when the system was getting migrated ( for the second time ). Given that no automated tools were being used up to that point , and the system was split into 5 different air-gapped sub-systems , a printed sheet Change Request form and a Microsoft Excel-based System Versioning Document was enforced from the beginning of the 2 week migration period . The first week was “lost” to filling these forms and ensuring that the 5 systems had exactly the same configuration . However , for the second week , we were able to make huge strides and deliver the system on time because we were so confident in the configuration of all systems .',\n",

       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Implementing the 5 disciplines for projects, Paragraph = Configuration Control) While a formal change request process involving the client is too unweildy for the development period of the project , having a track of how and when files changed is very helpful for troubleshooting . This is where the use of an automated software versioning tool is important . Some tools , such as GIT , are much stronger than others , say SVN , in keeping a tight control of the state of files . In GIT , it is possible to set up a system where if a file is to be changed , it has to first go through a merge request process , that needs to be evaluated and accepted by a senior engineer . By contrast , in SVN , users can update the files they want , but it is possible to write a small note when updating a file that is being version controlled . It is up to the project manager , with his lead technical engineer , to decide the importance of this through the development phase of the project . Important Note : it is essential that for any coding development done , for instance , the development of Compass drivers , that a more rigorous change control process is followed . Because of the importance of this , there is a separate document that explains this in detail , the Software Developer’s Guide . Difficulties with deliverables that required in-house coding development , that did not follow good coding practices , as outlined in these processes , have led to months of delays and extra costs for projects . This may mean that a different automated software versioning tool is used for coding development than for keeping track of the correct version/checksum of system files . Please see the section on Software Development earlier in this document .',\n",
       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Configuration_Management_for_Projects, Chapter = Implementing the 5 disciplines for projects, Paragraph = Configuration Control) Before the full introduction of the processes set out in the Software Developers Guide , a project had a difficult reverse-engineering task of translating a competitors 20 year-old satellite archive files .

Following the same CM system as during the Pre-SAT phase is no longer acceptable . Contractually , the system in its current state has been officially agreed by all parties to be good enough to be delivered . Any more rigorous testing required by the client due to sloppily-managed changes will be expensive and risk the delivery date and acceptance of the project .

In the case of a Purchase Order , it needs to be signed by the customer in order to be valid . Note : The President of Kratos Communication SAS may elect to take leadership on the contract discussions , reviews and signature . That would be reflected by the fact that the contract documentation is already signed . The case will be refered to as presigned in the following . In that case , the PM is still responsible for driving the Contract Review Process , however he/she has no control anymore on the content of the contract . The steps below still apply , except step 5 where the contractual clauses can no longer be modified . On receipt of the proposed contract or purchase order , the following steps are performed : The Operations Manager designates a Project Manager . The Proposal Manager or the Operations Manager sends the contract or purchase order to the Contract Administrator and the designated Project Manager . The type of contract triggers a different management of the Contract Review . If the Contract/Order is for a new job , a new job is created and a new Contract Review is initiated . The Contract Administrator creates a folder under “ISE_Contracts” and creates a new subfolder KC-30XXX-CR-0001 using this template . The folder name is provided by the OM . It shall include the following fields : <Job Number> <Customer Name> <End Customer Name ( optional )> <Project Name> <Product Name ( optional )>. The folder will serve as the main repository for all versions of the contractual documents to be generated during the negotiation phase , the final version will be identified clearly . A shortcut or link to the relevant proposal workspace is also created to allow an easy access for the OM and PM to all proposal documents and history . The Contract Administrator initializes the Contract Contract Review Checklist KC-30XXX-CR-0001_0 . 1 : Project number , Name , Contract amount , the Completion period , Project Manager . The Contract Administrator sends the Contract Review Checklist and the associated folder to the Project Manager in order to starts the contract review . If the Contract/Order is for an existing job , and has a positive or negative impact on the contract value , the existing job is reused , and a new Contract Review is created under the existing job . The Contract Administrator reuses the existing folder under “ISE_Contracts”, and creates a new subfolder KC-30XXX-CR-000Y using the template folder under \\\\ManagementFolder Template . The Contract Administrator initializes the Contract Review Checklist KC-30XXX-CR-000Y_0 . 1 : Project number , Name , Contract amount , the Completion period , Project Manager . The Contract Administrator sends the Contract Review Checklist and the associated folder to the Project Manager in order to starts the contract review . If the Contract/Order is for an existing job , and has no impact on the contract value , the existing job is reused , and the existing Contract Review is updated under the existing job . The Contract Administrator initializes the Contract Review Checklist KC-30XXX-CR-000Y_Z . 1 : Project number , Name , Contract amount , the Completion period , Project Manager . The Contract Administrator sends the Contract Review Checklist and the associated folder to the Project Manager in order to starts the contract review . The Project Manager leads the review and negotiation process . This may include : Check if the contractual documentation is already signed ( presigned ), and check the corresponding box accordingly . If true , the steps below are merely about gathering records with the President Reviews of the contractual terms with the Contract Manager and proposed amendments Reviews of the offer and contract with the Proposal Manager Reviews of the requirements Reviews of the schedule Reviews with the Shipping Manager for shipping , customs Reviews with Finance Manager for bank guarantees , performance bonds Identification of risks on the project . Filling of the Contract Review Checklist with the information gathered at the previous steps . Details on how to fill the Contract Review Checklist are provided in Annex 1 . The Project Manager and the Operations Manager review the Contract Review Checklist . If the draft contract requires an update , it is sent to the customer for approval of modifications . At each new draft version of the contract , a new intermediate version of the contract review checklist is saved to track the changes and negociations . The Project Manager works in coordination with the Contract Manager or the Operations Manager to make sure that all contractual clauses are acceptable . Once the negotiation phase is finished , the Operations Manager approves the final version of the Contract Review Checklist . In the case of a Purchase Order , the CR Checklist is signed by the Project Manager and by the Operations Manager . The Operations Manager notifies the Contract Administrator . The Project Manager submits the acknowledgement letter to the Kratos Communications SAS President for signature . The acknowledgement letter is based on ACK template except if the customer requests his own format . The Project Manager or designee sends the acknowledgement of order to the customer . This step is not applicable if presigned In the case of a contract to be signed , the contract is sent by the Project Manager to the Kratos Communications SAS President and to the customer for signature ( the order depends on the customer requirement ). Once the contract has been signed by both parties CR Checklist is signed and the Operations Manager notifies the Contract Administrator . This step is not applicable if presigned The Project Manager archives the signed contract or acknowledgement letter . The Delivery Owner updates the Sales Force opportunity and checks POP , Solutions components , Revenue type , delivery org and all relevant project fields . The Contract Administrator updates the Kratos Communications SAS booking file . The Contract Administrator updates the CRM opportunity based on the information present in the Contract Review Cheklist dedicated section and set it to the status “Closed won” as follows : Definitions : 1 . The booking date is defined as the funding date for a given contract or PO . 2 . The effective date is defined as the day the company is obligated to the contract/PO . 3 . The “effective date” and the “booking date” are different and **are not** interchangeable . The field “Close Date” will take the value of the booking date , which is determined as follows : Contract/PO signed by both parties : The booking date is the date of the last signature on contract/PO , or ACK from Kratos . The field “POP start” will take the value of the Effective Date of Contract ( EDC ). There are four potential methods to determine the effective date of the contract/PO : 1 . Contract/PO Identifies the effective date : If the contract specifically identifies an effective date and we agree to accept the contract with the specifically identified effective date , then this is the effective date . 2 . Contract/PO signed by both parties : If the contract does not specifically identify an effective date , then the booking date is the date of the last signature on contract/PO . 3 . Contract/PO signed by customer only : If unilateral in nature , meaning there is only a customer signature , AND we accept the order as is ( even if acceptance is after the customer signature ), the effective date will be the date of the customer signature . 4 . Contract/PO not signed by either party : If there is no signature by either party , then the effective date is the “date stamp” of the contract/PO if we accept as is ( regardless of when we reviewed it ), or if the “date stamp” is not available , the effective date will be the date of written acceptance by Kratos contracts . The field “POP end” will take the value of the end of the entire project ( end of month ). The Contract Administrator notifes the Accounting Manager about the new or updated order , copy President , Operations Manager , Project Manager , Proposal Manager , Accounting Manager , Finance Manager and Kratos Sales Operations . The Project Manager provides the Accounting Manager the preliminary ETC ( EAC ) in order to support the PSF and project creation . The Accounting Manager and Project Manager review with OP Manager the revenue recognition method and related costs accounting , in the meeting planned by the Project Manager . At the latest the ETC is needed before the end of the first period where revenue is taken . At all times , the Contract Administrator files records of the contract elements being discussed , contract reviews . The PM ensures records are properly transferred for filing and filing is performed . In particular , the Contract Review Folder must contain only one version of the following documents required by accounting : 1 . Contract signed by both parties or PO signed by customer 2 . Applicable offer from Kratos 3 . Signed Contract Review All intermediate or draft versions must be stored in Misc or Draft folders . The PM decides if the contract review checklist is completed once for all negotiations or with several iterations . There must be at least one version corresponding to the final signed contract ( or approved PO ) based on bullet 6 . above . Any changes in the contract must be record according to the Change Management process',\n",

       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Subcontractor_Management_Process, Chapter = Introduction) This procedure addresses selection , management , and evaluation of subcontractors involved with Kratos projects . Subcontractors , as used in this procedure , refer to project participants functioning under a project’s work breakdown structure ( WBS ). These resources provide time and materials toward completion of the project goals . Suppliers of material goods that are not a part of the WBS are classified as vendors and are addressed in the Purchasing Procedure . Function Authority and Responsibility Operations Manager Determines need for subcontracts . Define Mission and deliverables . Selects subcontractors . Provides performance evaluation input to the subcontractor file . Project Managers Express need for subcontractors mission and deliverable . Help select subcontractors . Purchasing Develops subcontractor agreements . Maintains subcontractor file . Solicits performance evaluation input to the subcontractor file on a quarterly basis . Quality Manager reviews the subcontract documentation for QA compliance and reports to Management Review Team . New subcontractor relationships may be developed by business circumstances , single source product / service , or contract / customer designation . The use of subcontractors is determined by the Kratos Operations Manager ( OM ) in consideration of the needs of the contract . The OM has lead responsibility and authority for subcontractor selection and management . This responsibility includes definition and execution of control mechanisms for project management , subcontract administration , business operations , and technical management . The control mechanisms are defined as required by the Project Maneger ( PM ) in the project plans and in the statement of work ( SOW ) or Purchase Order ( PO ). These documents clearly define work , responsibilities , lines of communication , and relational dependencies . Subcontractor agreements are jointly developed by the operations and Purchasing . The contract agreement is maintained by OM . Each subcontractor agreement will be maintained in a separate folder . The amount of management oversight is administered according to the subcontract’s scope and the criticality of the project task ( s ). Contract compliance and cost / budget parameters are provided to Purchasing by the OM . Kratos is ultimately responsible for delivering quality products to customers even if the subcontractor’s product or contribution does not meet Kratos quality requirements . The primary Kratos parties that are responsible for subcontractor management are Purchasing for business , Purchasing for administration , and Project Managers ( PMs ) for project performance . Both have responsibility to maintain corporate policy and to ensure product quality and integrity . Kratos will establish safeguards if a subcontractor’s future or its products become unstable or a risk to the success of the project . Safeguards include establishing an escrow account of technical information that would ensure the maintenance of the product or service rendered , reinforcing the subcontractor task , or replacing the subcontractor . Each project describes in its project plan the method it will use to accomplish the unified team approach ( see the Project and Quality Planning procedure ). To ensure that the project requirements are met and risk is minimized , Kratos maintains qualifications records in the subcontract folders to support the subcontractor selection process . Each subcontract folder contains subcontractor qualifications regarding their ability to support Kratos endeavors in accordance with Kratos corporate policies and contractual obligations . As appropriate , each subcontract folder additionally may contain quality related standards and practices used by the subcontractor , as well as notes / recommendations based on previous Kratos experience . Purchasing solicits from the PMs input to these subcontract folders on a yearly basis . PMs can use the information from these subcontract folders to evaluate a subcontractor’s possible contribution with a good degree of certainty about the outcome .',\n",

Some new requirements can be extracted from customer requirements . Kratos shall manage the subcontracting company responses to the customer requirements by : Discussing the responses with the subcontractor until they reach a satisfactory level of compliance ( if this level cannot be reached , Kratos will reject the subcontractor ) Reflecting the subcontractor responses in the Kratos response to the customer',\n",

This phase is under the responsability of the “Point of contact”. The “Point of contact” will report to the OM immediately if any no resolved problems . Subcontractors are managed through their subcontracting company : A Kick Of meeting is done with the subcontracting company to start the mission . A “Point of contact” is identified and will be Kratos main point of contact with regard to the project execution . Subcontractor deliverables are identified into the project schedule . Periodic progress meetings are done with the subcontracting company manager ( Quarterly at least ). Vendor Evaluation is performed on the subcontracting company . The “Point of contact” will inform Kratos about any team member vacancy . If the project execution requires a subcontractor to modify his/her working hours , as defined by the contracting company , a request shall be made to the subcontracting company by the PM . A subcontractor’s performance requirements , interfaces , deliverables ( including reports and documentation ), and testing requirements are clearly specified and documented in a SOW and / or PO / Contract between Kratos and the subcontracting company . This eliminates misunderstandings during the subcontractor’s development process . Additionally , subcontractor deliverable are identified into the project schedule . This allows the OM and PM constant insight into subcontractor progress and whether milestones are met . In performing development efforts for an Kratos project , the subcontractor will be held to the same quality standards that we have established for the prime contract . The PM or designee is responsible for monitoring the deliverables and providing information to the subcontractor . The subcontractor will submit detailed reports covering development status , programmatic or technical problems , and plans for the following period at intervals specified in the SOW or PO / Contract . Efforts such as design reviews , walkthroughs , and product demonstrations will include the system components provided by the subcontractor to ensure consistent management control throughout the project . Subcontractors providing finished , “turn-key” system components based on their own design , may be required to implement their own QA/CM if specified in the SOW or PO . Subcontractors who change the design of their product during the term of the procurement order must obtain Kratos concurrence or the item is rejected at the source or on receipt . Subcontractor-identified changes affecting documents , software , or parts specified by the SOW require the subcontractor to submit a change request for Kratos approval and authorization before implementing the change . Subcontractors implementing system components designed by Kratos are required to produce the components in conformance with that design .

Purchasing will solicit from the PMs performance input , using the Vendor Evaluation Form , on a yearly basis or at the end of the mission of the subcontractor . In addition to the basic information reference for the initialization of the subcontractor entry , PMs provide performance comments and recommendations for the subcontract folder over the period of the project relationship by submitting the filled-out Subcontractor Evaluation Form as required .

Be sure to remember where the top is and where is the bottom of your box ( important for applying the stickers ). If you’re two people you can help yourself by using one of our rolling boards , one people handling the film the other turning the box around thanks to the board . 5 . You can use the safety combined cutter to cut out the film when finished ( the cutter is attached to the stickers distributing device ). 6 . Apply the shipping labels . Stickers are also available in the printer room with a distributing device ; they look more or less like this . At least one of these shipping label stickers shall be applied on any box sent .

       " 'Context : (Documentation = Quality Manual, Title = Handling_Storage, Chapter = Handling Best Practices) This chapter provides best practices for handling and storing boxes . 1 . All boxes that are stored at Kratos must be clearly labelled with a project identification label . Labels should be printed or written legibly with a marker pen . Do not use biro pen . Do not use exotic colours . Do not use Post-It notes – they fall off . The labels should be affixed to three adjacent faces at one of the corners of the box and oriented such that at least one label is legible when the box is in a stack . Avoid obscuring other markings . Labels should include the project number AND some indication of the project name ( a single word , for example the name of the customer , is sufficient ). Boxes that are not labelled , or whose labels are hard to identify , risk being destroyed . 2 . Boxes should be stacked so that the project identification labels are visible . 3 . Boxes should always be stacked the correct way up . If in doubt , note that this symbol points to the top : Up Symbol The picture below shows a box that does not follow the symbol : Incorrect handling 4 . Respect the stacking limits . This symbol means that the stack should include no more than n boxes : Stacking Symbol This box should not be in a stack of more than 7 boxes . Stacking Symbol 5 . Do not stack loaded boxes on top of empty boxes . Additional notes on how to label boxes : This box is correctly labelled - it has three printed labels on adjacent corners of the box . Box Correctly Labled This box is NOT correctly labelled – although it has a printed label , the label is not located at the corner and it appears on only one face . Box Incorrectly Labled This box is also NOT correctly labelled – it does not have labels on three adjacent corners , worse than that it has different labels on different sides . The “435” label on the front is not written in a contrasting colour ( and is hard to see ). The 30435 label on the top will be invisible when the box is in a stack and it does not include a project name . Be aware that suppliers and shippers also write numbers on boxes – so we need to be able to identify the project . In this case “30435 PSN” would be a good label .
