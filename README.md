# Virtual-Assistant
This repository contains the research and experimentation conducted during my internship in R&D and as part of my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science. The focus of my work was captured in a document titled: **"The LangChain Paradigm: Building Cost-Effective, Efficient AI Chatbots."**

Here, you'll find the code snippets and experiments associated with my master's thesis, which explores the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation **(RAG)** architecture to develop a cost-effective AI copilot utilizing a local Large Language Model **(LLM)**.

**LangChain** is highlighted in this review for its pivotal role in advancing virtual assistant technology by simplifying the **integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications**. Its **modular and customizable framework** allows developers to create context-aware, accurate, and efficient virtual assistants. By enabling the seamless connection of LLMs with various data sources, LangChain significantly enhances the capabilities of virtual assistants, making them more versatile and user-friendly across both commercial and academic settings.
