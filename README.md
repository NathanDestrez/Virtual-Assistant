This repository contains the research and experimentation conducted during my internship in R&D and as part of my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science. The focus of my work was captured in a document titled: **"The LangChain Paradigm: Building Cost-Effective, Efficient AI Chatbots."**

Here, you'll find the code snippets and experiments associated with my master's thesis, which explores the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation **(RAG)** architecture to develop a cost-effective AI copilot utilizing a local Large Language Model **(LLM)**.
